# minecraft-functions-replacement

I was trying to execute around 36000 commands, each one to set a block. But for some reason, functions inside datapacks wasn't working for me. So, I created this script to get the work done. 

Instructions to run:
1. Place all the commands you want to run in 'setblock_commands.txt'
2. It should be in the same repository as this code
3. Open terminal from here and run this python script (python minecraft_script.py)
